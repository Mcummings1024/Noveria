			<p>New Lands Acquired	21 April 2016</p>
			<p>On the same day as the signing of the Constitution, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14vp7LOtJcCQ5KYHlYG7F5EA5aOQ5uyqnvxBj-OOKJPQ/edit?usp=sharing">bill</a> was signed into law which decrees that certain islands in the Beaver Archipelago are now part of the sovereign territory of Noveria. The islands include a portion of Garden Island, and all of High and Hog Islands. The islands are uninhabited, and consist mainly of deciduous forest. An expedition to survey the newly acquired lands is expected to be approved for later this year.</p>
